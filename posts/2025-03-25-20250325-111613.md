**Today's plan** is to catch up the frontend of everything I've been building this mill backend for. The MVP I need to design (at least as it is in my head right now) features video content and a storefront.

## Video content

All of this is hosted on YouTube and we aren't going to change that. There are shorts and full length content, on phones we should display shorts where we display full length on desktop. The backend interfaces should support content management.

## Storefront

To start, we need to support merch and be ready for a quick extension into branded parts/design and booking (lessons).

I don't want to use Next.js for this, but I do still at least want to use probably Vite + React + Tailwind in some form. I have yet to figure these things out but hopefully those decisions can come out today.
