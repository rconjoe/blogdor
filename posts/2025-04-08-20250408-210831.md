I have a clockworkpi [devterm](https://www.clockworkpi.com/devterm) running an rpi CM4. It has this cool thermal printer attachment that I have [written code for in the past](https://github.com/rconjoe/oldsoul).

Might be cool to link that thing up with a ntfy instance and have it shoot off notifications about important things.

Just a thought.
