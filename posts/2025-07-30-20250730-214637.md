# State of my Analytics templates:

There are a couple of stragglers from the <a href="https://awesome-docker-compose.com/apps">list</a> due to complexity, but analytics have been worked through for now. Rudderstack and EDA were the only two new successful outings. Being the first outing with this workflow, I expect to come back to the first few categories to review later on.

# State of Automation templates:

I have started down the list finding so far that a lot of these are already done. I've made mny way past Activepieces, Automatisch, Changedetection.io, and have found myself working with Dagu (but so far the docker image they provide seems to be borked). I cannot get this docker image to find its own config or not throw permission errors on its own start commands, and I'm not willing to dig into it too much further, maybe I will run these images locally at some point or try to build my own.

Notably, Apache Airflow may be something we could get going on a template. It is complex but something I will put some hours into sometime soon if needed.

Dkron, Healthchecks, Huginn, Olivetin, Stackstorm, Tubesync, Upsnap, and Utask trmain for automation.

Then, onto archiving.
