For a good couple of weeks I've been getting loads of vtsls errors blowing up in the `nvim` status bar when editing `.tsx` files. Today I switched from the "typescript-all-in-one" astronvim pack to just a standard typescript setup, getting rid of at least denols crap I don't use. [7d20ca7](https://github.com/rconjoe/astro/commit/7d20ca732af1be08fa5f7f61b991ceae6d8997c2)

I also enabled files for "astrocore" and "astrolsp" ([b2234c6](https://github.com/rconjoe/astro/commit/b2234c627436b067ae5252e6ae3cf04d5178164f) and [813c560](https://github.com/rconjoe/astro/commit/813c560701038fa4a48903f076b7f0d89e0f8f24)) that I don't really know what they are beyond customization of settings for existing plugins.
I think it's all stuff that's been added while I've constantly just updated all my nvim stuff and that just flew under the radar.

Everything works for now it seems, 24 hours will tell.
