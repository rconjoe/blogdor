It turns out my docker VM uses the SMTP port (:25) needed by windmill. I don't know what for and I'm not about to look into why or pick apart the VM over it.

So I tried an LXC container, and that failed for some stupid reason I can't remember now but also was unwilling to fix given I have a known working environment for the entire Windmill setup on [Railway](https://railway.com/template/UI371k), and I am the template author for such a project on Railway. It's out of date but I decided to fuck around.

Turns out it's been used in 133 projects since November, 26 currently running. 100% success on deploys which is rare...why fight with Proxmox over it?

So tonight and tomorrow my goal is to get this setup and tested on railway, and a decision made as to whether or not I'd like to pursue this route over something like Medusa.
