Today I released <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/railway-node">railway-node</a>, a Node.js client wrapper library for Railway's graphQL API.

It's quite simple, just the generated files made by `genql` that I wrapped up in npm packaging.

Hopefully some other people can find use out of it, too.

I will also setup CI pipelines to rebuild it every so often, based on how often they update the API.
