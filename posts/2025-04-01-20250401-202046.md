# Stripe has gotten worse over the years

When I used it for Provana back in 2020, Stripe was an awesome solution. Nowadays the slight friction points that existed back then have grown into full blown double-states you're expected to maintain between Stripe's webhooks and your own data.

Theo's gist is an absolute lifesaver and likely saved me some serious trouble.
