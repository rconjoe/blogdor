Today I am going to piece together a local [Windmill](https://windmill.dev) setup in my homelab and try to build out some basic ecommerce backend functionality, a Windmill app to control some of it, and then make an electron app that simply loads that Windmill app with credentials in a native environment.

The purpose of this is so that:

1. store admin has native app for back office stuff
2. updating that native app = simply updating the Windmill app
3. I can develop the backend myself while maintaining velocity
4. it's not another dogwater ecommerce platform
