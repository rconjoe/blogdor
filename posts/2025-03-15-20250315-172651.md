I've setup a windmill instance from my old template and assigned it a hostname on my trog.codes domain.

Windmill has had some nice updates. For some reason I have to restart each worker to get it to show up in the server dash. I am hoping this doesn't persist beyond updates.

The next step is to start establishing if key processes can be easily setup on this mill instead of using a canned version like Medusa.
