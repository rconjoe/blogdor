# You can't do it

at least if you want to have sync capabilities. While service tokens give you a key-secret pair to pass as headers with requests, I'd have to modify the wmill cli source and rebuild my own in order to set custom headers to include that stuff, so forget it. Way out of scope for my needs.

In the meantime I am interested in in at some point editing the sync script make a commit for each folder with changed files. Not a priority, but eventually.
