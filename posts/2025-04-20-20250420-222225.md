Dan seems to be struggling with LGSM stuff lately. There is a lack of contributors during an influx of users.

I am posting this mostly for accountability and to remind myself to continually look into the backlog for him. I sent him a dm to check if there is anything to prioritize, but I should absolutely try to contribute more to this project. I have sponsored it for almost a decade and triaged issues for a long time, but never PR'd any of my own additions (they were often client-specific).
