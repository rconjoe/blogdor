# <a href="https://awesome-docker-compose.com/apps/automation">Automation</a>

**Activepieces**: Two already exist.

**Airflow**: None exist, looks like a multi-day complex project. Consists of.

1. airflow-common

services:

- Psql
- Redis
- Webserver
- Scheduler
- Worker
- Triggerer

2. airflow- cli

3. flower

**Automatisch**: One exists.

**Changedetection Io**: Several exist.

**Dagu**: None exist, but each service requires config _and_ data volumes. Worth a try.

**Dkron** None exist, but this is just a cron clone...

**Healthchecks** One exists.

**Huginn** Interesting case - one exists, 56 deploys, but with a 0% success rate. It's a simple compose file, should look at this one.

**Olivetin** None exist

**Stackstorm** None exist

**Tubesync** None exist

**Upsnap** None exist

**Utask** None exist
