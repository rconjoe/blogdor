I have made a few relatively profitable templates on Railway, most notably <a href="https://railway.com/deploy/UI371k?referralCode=6KnY0h">Windmill</a>.

My task for the next week or two is to bust through a list of template-able apps I have compiled, and see how many of these can generate income.

I have already started paying attention to the <a href="https://station.railway.com/templates/windmill-c7084b70">station thread</a> on my template, and ran those queries through a fresh instance tonight.
