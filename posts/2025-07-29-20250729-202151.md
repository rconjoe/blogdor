I have quite enjoyed spending today making a workflow for rapidly prototyping, testing, and deploying <a href="https://railway.com/deploy">templates</a> to my favorite hosting platform, <a href="https://railway.com">Railway</a>.

Today I launched two new templates:

1. <a href="https://railway.com/deploy/rudderstack?referralCode=6KnY0h">RudderStack</a>

2. <a href="https://railway.com/deploy/eda?referralCode=6KnY0h">EDA</a>

in addition to my two existing templates, <a href="https://railway.com/deploy/UI371k?referralCode=6KnY0h">Windmill</a> and <a href="https://railway.com/deploy/5M2-4G?referralCode=6KnY0h">FluidCalendar</a>

I have a solid plan to launch at least 100 of these templates in the next month.
