[tonkas's world](https://tonkas.world) is a storefront and backend I put together a while back for a friend. It went up in a hurry so I used something that made sense for me, [Medusa](https://docs.medusajs.com/), since it's fairly simple, extensible, familiar to things I've used before, and entirely in TypeScript. It worked to get things up and running, but I've quickly decided that Next.js is a flaming dumpster for small projects, and Medusa, while awesome, may not be as good for my needs here as something else I could put together myself.

Ideas for this include:

1. Portable native electron app for my friend to run on his Mac, where he can manage not only things with his store, but also his YouTube
2. Featuring said channel on the storefront homepage
3. Integrating videos on the channel with products and funnels
4. Live streams from the bike
