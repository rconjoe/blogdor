What I did so far today was to take an Android device, put it in developer mode, and enable BT HCI logging while I use the AC Aduser app to execute commands on the Kelly controller. I then used `adb` to retrieve the logs and open them in Wireshark on my PC.

They came in as a `.cfa` file, which I don't know anything about, however Wireshark opened it just fine and exposed a bunch of Bluetooth RCOMM and SPP packets worth investigating.

_Update 07/29/25_: Rather than doing multiple parts, I will be back to update this post with progress.
