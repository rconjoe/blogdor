Putting it off for years...I have repaired a couple Go codebases but never took the time to learn to properly write one from scratch.

[This library](https://github.com/markus-wa/demoinfocs-golang/) has me at least trying. There is [a node alternative](https://github.com/LaihoE/demoparser/) that looks mighty fine and I also intend on benching. However the go library is super popular and I see getting it running on demos on my proxmill is a worthwhile endeavor that would yield valuable go knowledge in the meantime.

Off we go.
