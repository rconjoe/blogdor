         <p><code>wmill sync</code> was busted for me (as noted in an
earlier post). I have not tested this but it dawned on me earlier that
the instance I’ve been trying to sync from I have placed behind
cloudflare proxies with authorization, such that requests should not be
permitted if they are not first authorized via one of the methods I’ve
set up. This would include requests from wmill cli, of course.</p>
<p>So the way I see it, the following course of action is logical:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Temporarily disable auth on the domain and see if there is still a
failure</li>
<li>If so, to solve the issue, either:
<ol type="a">
<li>leave auth off, since it’s not really necessary for this subdomain,
only the management of the bare metal itself</li>
<li>explore something to grant programmatic auth, which I think on CF is
<a

tokens</a></li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
