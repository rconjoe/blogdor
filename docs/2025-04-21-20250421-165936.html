         <p>I had a friend ask if I could help diff out the code of a
modified Pokemon GBC game to figure out what they did. I was given the
known source (a git repo) and a 7z containing the git repo of the mod
source (and last built binaries).</p>
<p>Upon extracting the mod source, I noticed that it was the same
original git repo with all the changes just left untracked. This at
least lets us see, albeit without any context, the changes that were
made.</p>
<p><img src="../images/pokediff.png" alt="diffing the changes" width=800 /></p>
<p>I figured that to make sense of the changes, it would first make
sense to get a build pipeline going so we can fiddle with the modded
parts we don’t understand and see the effects. The build didn’t require
anything weird (git, gcc, bison) except for <a
href="https://rgbds.gbdev.io/">rgbds</a>, a GameBoy Color modding
framework. It is <a href="https://rgbds.gbdev.io/docs/v0.9.1">well
documented</a>.</p>
<p>After an initail build, <code>make</code> spit out an error about an
invalid <code>rgbds</code> flag, <code>-L</code>. Removing the flag in
the makefile rendered uglier-looking compile errors.</p>
<p>I noticed that the last commit to the existing code was made in
mid-2021, so I matched up rgbds versions according to the latest at that
time, built <code>rgbds</code> from source, then ran the Makefile
against that version. Success!</p>
<p>Next I will fiddle with the code and start to make sense of the
assembly changes, so I can add some context missing from them
currently.</p>

        “Programming is a Dark Art, and it always will be. The programmer is
        fighting against the two most destructive forces in the universe:
        entropy and human stupidity. These are not things you can overcome with
        a “methodology” or on a schedule.” - Damian Conway
