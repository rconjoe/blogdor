         <p><strong>Let’s say you’ve got a friend willing to grant you
access to a Proxmox node in their homelab.</strong></p>
<p>For a long time, the most likely course of action would have been to
reverse proxy a port on his homelab’s network and forward it to the
Proxmox host:8006. Nowadays it’s just a fact that there are more secure
ways to do this.</p>
<h1 id="cloudflare-tunnels">Cloudflare Tunnels</h1>
<p>I love these. They are free and allow you to securely expose services
in a private network through private tunnels to a proxy, with quite a
bit of granularity.</p>
<p>There are two things you get from Cloudflare:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>A proxy server</li>
<li>A daemon program to run on the machine you want hosted</li>
</ol>
<p>Instead of traditionally managing the proxy yourself (e.g. nginx
reverse proxy), you can offload that responsiblity onto a Cloudflare
server, and associate a DNS record with it - the one you want to point
to your locally hosted service.</p>
<p>Then, you install <code>cloudflared</code> on the local machine and
run one simple <code>cloudflared service</code> command with a key used
to connect to the proxy server. Once this happens, there is a private
tunnel established between the two machines, and you can choose a
protocol and address:port on the local network where to exactly where
the service is located, e.g. <code>localhost:8006</code>. The result
works as follows:</p>

<h1 id="why-is-this-better-than-reverse-proxies">Why is this better than
reverse proxies?</h1>
<p>Simple - with this setup, absolutely nothing on your homelab network
is directly exposed to the internet. No ports are forwarded. There is no
massive attack vector being exposed:</p>
<p><img src="../images/tunnelsecure.png" alt="tunnel security" width=800 /></p>
<p>Additionally, Cloudflare lets you set up authentication layers on the
proxy and it’s shockingly easy to do. For instance, on many of my
subdomains, your requests don’t get forwarded to the machine on the
other side of the proxy unless you authenticate with an auth provider
hosted on Cloudflare via GitHub OAuth login. A session token is
dispatched which you can then use for the duration of the application
session.</p>
<p>This way there is yet <em>another</em> layer of protection that makes
it impossible for an attacker to even determine any information about
the target machine like IP or hostname.</p>
