      <p>
        A years-out-of-practice classical pianist and church organist, I bought
        a <a href="https://www.akaipro.com/mpcliveii">MPC Live II</a> to get
        back into music. Here are some tracks I've made on it. Further down, you
        will find some of my super old recordings from a past life.
        <br />
        <br />
        I'm not much of a producer but I love writing hooks.

            One of the few things on here that's not a hip-hop beat, this is a
            song by Sunny Suljic that I covered to get better at using the MPC
            like an actual DAW. That is, no samples, just audio recordings. I
            used a Presonus Audiobox USB as the MPC's audio interface, and a 20
            year old MXL pencil condenser to record.
