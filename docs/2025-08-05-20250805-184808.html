         <p>Recently, I launched
<a href="https://bigtonk.com">bigtonk.com</a>, a website for a friend of
mine.</p>
<p>This site is part of a larger group of services, some done and some
not. As far as this page goes, it’s built on a Postgres DB with
<a href="https://docs.railway.com/reference/functions">Railway
Functions</a> for an API. I like these because they are super
lightweight, cheap, and provide fast access to my database, so it’s
perfect for small CRUD API’s. They run a small
<a href="https://hono.dev/">hono</a> app I can run with bun nicely.
There are endpoints for each table in the DB required to render the
page.</p>
<p>A few days later I whipped up another Railway Function that runs on a
cron every six hours and refreshes the 3 most recent videos and 6 most
recent shorts from his YouTube channel. While I initially wrote the cron
into the bun code, I later moved it out in favor of the cron
functionality available as an option when configuring a service hosted
on the platform. While it achieves the same thing, it’s much easier for
me to monitor logs this way if I ever need to.</p>
<p>The next step is to build out the store tab. I have the UI built for
this on the site side, there is a working cart and dummy products filled
in, albeit hardcoded into the react components for now. I initially had
plans to build out a minimal, but fully custom, ecommerce backend on a
selfhosted Windmill instance, but after wasting a bunch of time
reinventing several wheels, I decided to default back to MedusaJS which
I have a fair amount of experience with.</p>
<p>So, the ecommerce backend at the time of writing is currently a
second Postgres for Medusa, selfhosted Redis, Mellisearch and MinIO
instances, and the Medusa backend.</p>
<p>Today’s task is to link up Medusa’s API with my frontend store
components and kick out the placeholder data.</p>
