more people understood about data</h1>
<p>I made this venn diagram to illustrate a data problem often
encountered in the backend of ecommerce operations.</p>
<p><img alt="data schema venn diagram" src="../images/schemavenn.png" width="600" /></p>
<p>How does one solve this?</p>
<p>I’ve seen the process called ETL, ELT, and many other names, but
basically consists of the following:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Store the data in one place exactly how it comes in</li>
<li>Store the data how you need it in another place</li>
<li>Write pipelines between the two databases</li>
<li>Build a system to manage the triggers</li>
</ol>
<p>Windmill is absolutely incredible for this.</p>
<p>I want to have a Postgres serve as the main source of truth and the
database that contains the data owned and input by back office. A
dashboard, which I hope can be a mill app running in an electron shell,
will serve as a data entry point. Pipelines are activated to ETL this
data into a Redis “cache” which will actually serve as the primary
database accessed by the storefront.</p>
<p><img alt="a rough sketch of the idea" src="../images/tonka-data-plan.png" width="800" /></p>
<h3 id="easy-to-draft">Easy to draft</h3>
<p>I like that by using the postgres instance <em>we</em> interact with
as a source of truth for data which is then transformed into
use-specific data, we can setup operations such that drafting everything
from design ideas to entire products is easy, since new pipelines are
easy to add and the process doesn’t change.</p>
<h3 id="flexible">Flexible</h3>
<p>Given we are careful to prioritize input validation to the postgres,
the workflow is simple yet allows for flexibility since as long as
information ends up in the cache according to the schema dictated by its
use case (the storefront). We are never “jamming” data into the
storefront or into any of our databases, since we just perform operation
on it and have a copy of it at the start and end of each operation.</p>
<h2 id="event-driven">Event-driven</h2>
<p>Buzz word but whatever, I like when business operations work one way,
I don’t care what that way is. But to say that “in order for data to
change, some known and explicitly handled event must occur” is a very
neat way to handle things in practice.</p>
<p>I’m going to go work on this some more this evening…</p>
