<p>Over the last few weeks, I have spent a lot of time getting to know
<a href="https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/">Electron</a>.</p>
<p>Being super comfortable with the process of cramming javascript into
places it doesn’t belong, I am already adept with a good chunk of the
curriculum. The only thing that has been in the dark for me for years is
the specifics on how to use electron IPC. I understand that Electron
uses a special Chromium instance, Node.js and a process isolation model
between the two. A main process runs as a native context on the user’s
OS, which spawns sandboxed BrowserWindow instances (whose process is
called a “renderer”). BrowserWindows in Electron are just undecorated
Chromium windows with stunted permissions. I have focused on learning
the surface areas of:</p>
<ul>
<li><a
href="https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/api/ipc-main">ipcMain</a></li>
<li><a
href="https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/api/ipc-renderer">ipcRenderer</a></li>
<li><a
href="https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/api/browser-window">BrowserWindow</a></li>
</ul>
<p>So far my understanding is that these are essentially three of the
most core pieces of using IPC. Everything revolves around nodejs
EventEmitters and a “Context Bridge” that is used to expose individual
functions from the main process to the Chromium <code>window</code>
available in the renderer process.</p>
<p>I thought a good exercise would be to get something like an OAuth
code grant flow working in an Electron app, since this requires
familiarity with:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>spawning windows, since we must open one to send the user to the
OAuth url,</li>
<li>IPC between the main process and renderers, so the main process can
make requests with secrets and complete the OAuth grant flow in
conjunction with the renderer process.</li>
</ol>
<p>I’ve been able to get decently far, but right now am stuck with an
IPC issue I am still debugging my way through: I am able to open a new
window to the twitch.tv auth URL, get a scope approvals prompt, and
redirect back to localhost:5173 - however the redirect happens in the
popup window instead of following the code I <em>thought</em> I got
right, which says to extract the access_token, send it to the backend,
and close the popup window. So something towards the end of the process
is going wrong, since I am getting a successful redirect but am screwing
up either the code extraction or the “close the popup window” directives
in electron.</p>
