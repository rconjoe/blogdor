You've stumbled into a geek's cave.

This is where I try to document some of the things I do in programming and whatever other tangential areas. I may also journal about chess, music, or whatever rabbit holes I fall into.

## About Me

I write code and tinker with things that look like I could take them apart.

## This Site is just HTML + CSS

This blog is intentionally minimalist - just markdown files I transform to HTML with pandoc. No JavaScript, no analytics, no cookies - just pure HTML and CSS, because that meets my requirements here.
