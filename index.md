You've stumbled into a geek's cave.

This is where I try to document some of the things I do in programming and whatever other tangential areas.

## About Me

I write code and tinker with things that look like I could take them apart.

## This Site is just HTML + CSS

This blog is intentionally minimalist - just markdown files transformed to HTML using pandoc. No JavaScript, no analytics, no cookies - just pure HTML and CSS, because that meets my requirements here.
