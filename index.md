You've stumbled into a geek's cave.

This is where I try to document some of the things I do in programming. All posts can be found in the <a href="archive.html">archive</a>.

## About Me

I've been writing code for over a decade, and tinker with anything that looks like I could take it apart. I worked at <a href="https://www.df.com">Diamond Foundry</a>, built <a href="https://www.vrai.com">VRAI.com</a>, and am a longtime open source contributor to projects like <a href="https://linuxgsm.com">LinuxGSM</a>. Nowadays I mostly teach and audit codebases.

I also make <a href="music.html">music</a> for fun.
