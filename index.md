You've stumbled into a geek's cave.

This is where I try to document some of the things I do with code and whatever other tangential areas.

## What You'll Find Here

- Ramblings of a semi-employed developer and sysadmin
- Half-baked ideas that might become something someday
- Various rabbit holes I've fallen into
- Anything I find worth writing about to remember later

## About Me

I write code and tinker with things that look like I could take them apart.

## This Site is just HTML + CSS

This blog is intentionally minimalist - just markdown files transformed to HTML using pandoc. No JavaScript (except to syntax highlight code - thanks [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org), no analytics, no cookies - just pure HTML and CSS, because that meets my requirements here.
