You've stumbled into a geek's cave.

This is where I try to document some of the things I do in programming. All posts can be found in the <a href="archive.html">archive</a>.

## About Me

I've been writing code since 2018 and tinker with anything that looks like I could take it apart.

I also make music for fun, which you can find <a href="https://trog.codes/music.html">here</a>.

This blog is intentionally minimalist - a bash script is used to transform markdown files to HTML using `pandoc`. No JavaScript, no analytics, no cookies.
