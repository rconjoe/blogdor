## About Me

I've been writing code for over a decade. I built <a href="https://www.vrai.com">VRAI.com</a> for <a href="https://www.df.com">Diamond Foundry</a>, infrastructure for <a href="https://fragadelphia.com/">Fragadelphia</a>, and am a longtime open source contributor to projects like <a href="https://linuxgsm.com">LinuxGSM</a>.

Nowadays, I teach and audit codebases.
