You've stumbled into a geek's cave.

This is where I try to document some of the things I do in programming. All posts can be found in the <a href="archive.html">archive</a>.

I also make <a href="https://trog.codes/music.html">music</a> for fun.

This blog is intentionally minimalist - a bash script is used to transform markdown files to HTML using `pandoc`. No JavaScript, no analytics, no cookies.
