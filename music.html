      <h1>you've found my musical notepad</h1>
      <p>
        I'm a years-out-of-practice classical pianist and church organist. I
        bought a <a href="https://www.akaipro.com/mpcliveii">MPC Live II</a> to
        get back into music. Here are some tracks I've made on it. Farther down,
        you will find some of my super old recordings from a past life.

            Not far from a complete arrangement. blast.wav is homophonous to
            blastwave, for whom this track is titled, as it was previously
            unnamed and he seemed to enjoy it.

          <p class="description">
            One of the few things on here that's not a hip-hop beat, this is a
            song by Sunny Suljic that I covered to get better at using the MPC
            like an actual DAW. That is, no samples, just audio recordings. I
            used a Presonus Audiobox USB as the MPC's audio interface, and a 20
            year old MXL pencil condenser to record.

          These are songs written by a friend of mine in high school, Teddy
          Roberts, which I recorded and produced in a garage when I was 16 with
          my childhood best friend (now tour managing for 311 and I Prevail). I
          am quite proud of these tracks. Many of the other tracks are still
          lost, so the ones I have found are here for archival purposes. I still
          think they are quite good music.
